// the process for editing files locally
// and push them to the remote server side


first edit the files

then use the command "git add XXXX"  to add the file to tmp area

then use "git commit -m "balabala" " to commit the change to local master

and at last use command "git push origin master" to push your change to remote server side

// one tip for you:
to avoid the conflict use "git fetch origiin" and "git merge origin/master" before every editing operations (or use "git pull origin master" instead)

good luck!

last tip :  use  "git status" to see the status of your git repo and remote repo any time, at ease
